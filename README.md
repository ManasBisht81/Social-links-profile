## My process

I began by planning a clean, mobile-first layout.  
Then, I built the HTML structure, styled it using CSS Flexbox, and added hover animations for interactivity.  
Throughout development, I focused on accessibility, simplicity, and responsive design for a better user experience.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

This project taught me how small design choices can make a big difference in user experience.  
I practiced building layouts using **Flexbox**, styling buttons with **hover transitions**, and keeping the design minimal yet attractive.  
It also helped me understand how to make a page **fully responsive** across all screen sizes.
